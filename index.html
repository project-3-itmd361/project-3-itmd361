            <p>Hi, guys! My name is Sujia Wu, a senior at Illinois institute of Technology. I am a business major, specialized in Finance and I will graduate in May 2017. I really enjoy taking this ITM 361 class and I believe that I will learn a lot from this class. Out of my school life, I like going jogging and swimming. I also like dogs, especially big dogs. I have a Doberman Pinscher and a German Shepherd.</p>
